      <ul class="margined bulleted">
        <li>Workshops need to explicitly state the group(s) of underrepresented people they are reaching out to. This should be toward the top of the workshop description. (It is often forgotten.)</li>
        <li>Workshop should be free (not usually a problem).</li>
        <li>The event dates make sense (aren't in the past, aren't super far apart).</li>
        <li>Fix typos if you feel like it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If anything is unclear or if you have questions, email the organizer (their email address is listed under the Google map on the event page). You can also seek guidance from <%= mail_to "board@railsbridge.org" %>.</p>
