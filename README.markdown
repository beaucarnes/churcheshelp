# Churches Help

Churches Help is a Rails app that helps churches plan their events. Also, it allows people to find one-time events and ongoing ministries near them.

This project is currently in production and has not officially launched. It is based off of [Bridge Troll](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/).
